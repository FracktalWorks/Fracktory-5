<h4>Automatic Orientation on every model imported</h4>
<p>Every model imported into Fracktory now automatically gets an orientation that is optimized for 3D printing. This means that you can start slicing your model right away without having to manually rotate it first. This feature is especially useful for beginners who are not yet familiar with the best orientation for 3D printing. Turn off this feature  from Extentions -> Automatic Orientation -> Modify Settings.
