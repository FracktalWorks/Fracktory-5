<h4>Add soluble support only on  support interface</h4>
<p>Save on soluble support material by using it only on the interface between support infill and the part for simple models where majority of the support can be manually broken away while still leaving a clean print under the soluable support. "Soluble Support Optimisation" will show up under "Support" in Recomended Print Settings when printing with Dual Nozzle with a soluble support loaded.</p>
